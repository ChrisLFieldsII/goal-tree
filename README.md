# Goal Tree
Realize your goals! 

**This is the project I'm currently working on**:relaxed:

Pick a start and end date (if you're up for it!) for your goal and record your progress towards it. 

In the end, you will have a visual of the goals you achieved!!! Or maybe left half-baked. Either way that goal will never be forgotten and can be resumed or celebrated:tada:.

# Developed With:
1. React Native
2. Redux
3. Firebase

# Motivation
Knowing I have a tendency to leave goals/projects half-baked after awhile, I wanted to develop an app to help stop that. I mainly wanted to build an app with React Native and this gave me a good excuse.
